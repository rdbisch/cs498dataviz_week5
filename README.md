How Baseball Players Develop

This dashboard explores the effects of baseball performance over time by position, and salary.  The primary metric used is called "OPS+" which is "On-base Percentage plus Slugging", and both of these terms are weighted the league average.   See (http://m.mlb.com/glossary/advanced-stats/on-base-plus-slugging-plus).    The dataset was prefiltered to only show data where there was salary info (1985 and beyond), contain only batters (pitchers excluded), and to only contain data points with a sufficient number of At-Bats (100).    Keep in mind interpretting "Salary" for baseball is a tricky proposition because it is forced to be low during the first few years, despite performance.    Further, the data is being filtered to show only the first 10 years in the league, as the population is rather thin beyond that.
